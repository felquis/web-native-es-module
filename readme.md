## Vanilha Web

I did this repo to try some of the native JavaScript module APIs, the main one is the `import * from x` syntax, there's no fallbacks set up on this repo.

Live demo host at github pages -> https://felquis.github.io/web-native-es-module/index.html

## Install and run

1. Clone the repo
1. `yarn install`
1. `yarn dev`
1. open localhost:8080 in the browser

## Browser Support

It is supported by 95% of browser sessions in Brazil https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module

## Fallbacks

It should be focused in bundling the tag script with property type="module", would be a good candidate
